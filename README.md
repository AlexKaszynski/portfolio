# Personal Portfolio Project - MERN, HTML, & CSS
This project is to show my mastery over HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other backend features. Using the tools I've gathered and learned in my Mthree training I will make a home website for myself to host all of my art projects made on my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tetraguard).

## Section One: Making the Site
Setup:
This stage will comprise the last assignment from Mthree where we developed a MERN website from scratch (and prior assignments).

## Running the Server:
To Run server successfully, turn off any VPN's, then run the following backend lines;
        
        cd mern/server
        node server.js

Then run front-end;

        cd mern/client
        npm run start

## Step-1: 
Plan It Create a component tree mock up or wireframe outlining your project, include all associated directories, external node modules, routes, programs you will need ... etc. Screenshot or hand these in via your PR or assets folder.

## Step-2: Backend Routes & ODM

Using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, and Postman create all 6 of your CRUD routes
You should have two collections: Users & Bugs
Screenshot, videocast/screen-record, or gif these routes working and include them in your PR or assets folder

## Step-3: 
Consuming Your API Client Side Within a Client folder create a font end application using React.js that allows for:

### The creation of new asset pages:
That user should then be able to create and interact with my art pages
And displayed in an INTERACTIVE table. I should be able to click on cells and interact with each bug by seeign more details, leaving notes, adjusting due date, etc, ...etc.

## Step-4: Styling
Make you entire application fully-styled and responsive per the past requirements.

# Outcome:
The focus here should be on mongo, mongoose, node, and react. We will get plenty of more testing practice in the weeks to come.

### Make sure that our application is RESTfull, 
meaning status codes & error handling included for all backend functionality along with verbose and UI friendly updates (red notice when soemthing is not added correctly, a note saying something was successfully deleted, ... etc)

Backend Taken from this helpful [Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial)

## Section Two: Server Hosting
This section will be completed at a later date once I am satisfied with my project development. It will be hosted on sushibar.games and be an offshoot from my brother's linux server.
